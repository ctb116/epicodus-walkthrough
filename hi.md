    git config --global user.email cathytbradley116@gmail.com

2. Create your project folder on your computer and start on the project!
Code code code etc

3. Soon, you'll need to make a commit to "save" your work. Commits are like snapshots that preserve your project in that moment in time you made a commit.

4. Once you are done with the project. the person who setup their info as the global user will push the chages to GitHub. Everyone else will fork that project so a copy is on their account too.

done!
